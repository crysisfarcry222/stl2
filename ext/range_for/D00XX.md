Introduction
=====

The current draft of the Ranges TS (CITE) loosens the requirements on the objects
used to denote a range. Today, two iterators of the same type are used to denote
a range. In the Ranges TS, a *sentinel* may be used to denote the end of a
range, where the type of the sentinel may be different from the type of the range's
iterator. The motivation for the loosening of this requirement is given in section
3.3.5 of [Ranges for the Standard Library, Revision 1][10][@n4128], but in short
it is to facilitate better code generation for many interesting kinds of ranges,
such as a range denoted by an iterator and a predicate.

Allowing the type of a range's end to differ from that of its begin causes problems
when the user tries to use such a range with the built-in range-based `for` loop,
which requires a range's begin and end to have the same type. This paper proposes
to lift that restriction for C++17, thereby giving users of the Ranges TS the best
possible experience.

Implementation Experience
=============

The author has implemented the described resolution in the clang compiler. The
implementation was as simple as removing the code that checks that `begin()` and
`end()` return objects of the same type. After this change was made, non-bounded
ranges (those for which `end()` returns a sentinel that is not an iterator) work
with the built-in range-based `for` loop.

Motivation and Scope
=====

The motivation is simple enough: to give the users of the Ranges TS the best
possible experience. If the ranges they create with the Ranges TS are not usable
with the built-in range-based `for` loop, it will reflect poorly both on the
Ranges TS and on the range-based `for` loop. In all likelihood, a macro-based
solution like [`BOOST_FOREACH`][][] will be invented to fill the gap.

The existing range-based `for` loop is over-constrained. The end iterator is never
incremented, decremented, or dereferenced. Requiring it to be an iterator serves
no practical purpose.

Technical Specifications
=====

**6.5.4  The range-based `for` statement [stmt.ranges]**

1\. A range-based `for` statement is equivalent to

<blockquote><code><del>{
  auto && __range = <em>for-range-initializer</em>;
  for ( auto __begin = begin-expr,
	         __end = end-expr;
	    __begin != __end;
	    ++__begin ) {
    <em>for-range-declaration</em> = *__begin;
    <em>statement</em>
  }
}</del></code></blockquote>

<blockquote><code><ins>{
  auto && __range = <em>for-range-initializer</em>;
  auto __begin = begin-expr;
  auto __end = end-expr;
  for ( ; __begin != __end; ++__begin ) {
    <em>for-range-declaration</em> = *__begin;
    <em>statement</em>
  }
}</ins></code></blockquote>

Acknowledgements
=====

I would also like to thank Herb Sutter and the Standard C++ Foundation, without
whose generous financial support The Ranges TS would not be possible.
