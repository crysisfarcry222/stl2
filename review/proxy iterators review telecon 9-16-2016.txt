iter_swap
---
Alisdair: make _Dereferencable a real concept? Consensus: no.
_Capitol names are ok!

Review wording validity of references after iterator operations (like increment)

iter_move:
"1. The return type is Ret where Ret is
remove_reference_t<reference_t<I>>&& if I is
a reference type; decay_t<I>, otherwise."

"1. The return type is Ret where Ret is
remove_reference_t<reference_t<I>>&& if reference_t<I> is
a reference type; decay_t<reference_t<I>>, otherwise."

[iterator.traits]
Marshall: do we really want to call this section iterator.traits? Answer: no we don't!
Use _v variable templates.
Jonathan: use std::conjunction. Wait, no, that's C++17. Leave it.
Remove bool_constant
Slurp in is_nothrow_swappable_with_v and friends.
Check Ranges TS for is_swappable_with conformance
Strike "Overload resolution" about iter_swap and iter_move customization point objects.

Make sure common_type_t<void, void> works.
Confer with Walter about specializing on types that depend on UDT (std::pair<MyType,int>).

Marshall: Shall we bring this to plenary to integrate into the Ranges TS?
Jonathan: ... subject to review of changes in Issaquah.
**No objections.**

TODO: Get updated Proxy Iterators paper into the pre-meeting mailing.
Bonus: have an updated Ranges TS for the post-meeting mailing.
