19.2.7 document char as such a type

19.2.9 question about why -> Same<T&>? Accepted as is. Suggestion for me to maintain a FAQ.
19.2.10 Swappable, take args by forwarding references


19.3.2 Example should be a numbered paragraph. Note that neither pointers nor types with explicit conversion to bool model Boolean.

19.3.3 Don't suggest that moved-from states are not well-formed. In other places as well. Walter: what should we say instead of "well-formed".

Remove editors note about Common and overconstraint

19.3.4 Common<T,U> doesn't need to be checked explicitly. It's reuired by EqualityComparable<T,U>

"non-modifying" -> "equality preserving"

19.4: update the rationale! It talks about objects, references are not objects.

19.4.1

19.4.2 Education: Constructible != is_constructible

19.4.4 MoveConstructible: references? What about 1.2.
